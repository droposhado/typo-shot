# Typo Screenshot

Typo is a script to take screenshot on your website / blog. A simpler way to check printing, viewing the page in complete.

You just need to provide a `site.json` file on your website. In the following format:

```
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "title": "Title",
      "url": "http://url.com"
    },
    {
      "title": "Title",
      "url": "http://url.com"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
